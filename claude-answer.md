I'll analyze your proposed AI-assisted development workflow and provide recommendations for optimizing it. This is a well-thought-out approach that balances AI assistance with architectural control.

## Analysis of Your Development Workflow

### Backend Development Steps - Assessment

Your backend approach is fundamentally sound. The key strengths are:

1. **Pre-defined architecture** - This is critical. Without it, AI agents tend to create inconsistent structures or mix concerns inappropriently.
2. **Clear API contracts** - Defining endpoints with explicit input/output models is exactly right.
3. **Layer separation** - Controllers, services, repositories is a proven pattern that AI can follow well.

**On task scope**: I recommend **splitting into endpoint-level tasks** with one important caveat - group related endpoints together (e.g., all User CRUD operations). This allows you to verify business logic coherence within a domain while maintaining focus.

### Frontend Development Steps - Assessment

The Figma integration is promising but needs refinement:

**Key considerations:**
- AI agents can extract component structure from Figma reasonably well
- They struggle with implicit interactions, animations, and responsive behavior
- The gap between visual design and data flow is where most issues occur

**Recommended enhancement**: Create a **component inventory document** alongside Figma that maps:
- Reusable components and their props
- State management boundaries
- Navigation flow
- Data fetching points

## Optimal Development Workflow

### Backend Workflow (Refined)

1. **Setup Phase**
   - Create starter project with your preferred framework
   - Implement architectural skeleton (folder structure, base classes, middleware, error handling patterns)
   - Set up dependency injection container if applicable
   - Configure linting, formatting, and testing framework

2. **Architecture Definition**
   - Create `ARCHITECTURE.md` documenting:
     - Layering principles (Controller → Service → Repository)
     - Cross-cutting concerns (logging, validation, auth)
     - Error handling strategy
     - Data flow patterns
   - Implement base/abstract classes that enforce patterns

3. **Domain-Driven Requirements**
   - Group requirements by **domain/resource** rather than individual endpoints
   - For each domain, specify:
     - **Data models** (entities, DTOs) with validation rules
     - **Business rules** that must be enforced
     - **Endpoint specifications** (method, path, auth, input, output, error cases)
     - **Dependencies** between domains
   - Example structure:
     ```
     ## User Domain
     
     ### Models
     - UserEntity (database)
     - UserDTO (API response)
     - CreateUserRequest (input)
     
     ### Business Rules
     - Email must be unique
     - Password must meet complexity requirements
     - New users start with 'pending' status
     
     ### Endpoints
     1. POST /users - Create user
        Input: CreateUserRequest
        Output: UserDTO
        Errors: 400 (validation), 409 (duplicate email)
        Logic: Hash password, validate email, save to DB, send welcome email
     ```

4. **Iterative Implementation**
   - **Task per domain** (e.g., "Implement User domain with CRUD operations")
   - Each task should produce:
     - Models/DTOs
     - Service layer with business logic
     - Repository layer with data access
     - Controller with endpoints
     - Unit tests for service layer
   - Review and verify before moving to next domain

5. **Integration Phase**
   - Cross-domain operations (e.g., Orders referencing Users)
   - Integration tests
   - API documentation generation

### Frontend Workflow (Refined)

1. **Design Phase**
   - Complete Figma designs
   - **Add design system documentation** to Figma (colors, typography, spacing, component variants)
   - Create a **component specification document**:
     ```
     ## Button Component
     Figma: [link to frame]
     Variants: primary, secondary, danger
     Props: label, onClick, disabled, loading
     States: default, hover, active, disabled
     ```

2. **Setup Phase**
   - Create starter project
   - Install and configure UI libraries (if using any)
   - Set up routing, state management, API client
   - Implement design system foundations (theme, tokens)

3. **Component Library Phase**
   - **Start with atomic components** before screens
   - Task per component type:
     - Input: Figma link + component spec
     - Output: React component with props, variants, and stories/tests
   - Build from atoms → molecules → organisms

4. **Screen Implementation Phase**
   - **Task per screen or related screen group**
   - For each task, provide:
     - **Figma frame link**
     - **Textual screen description**:
       ```
       ## User Profile Screen
       
       Layout: Header + Main Content + Footer
       
       Components:
       - ProfileHeader (shows avatar, name, edit button)
       - ProfileInfo (displays email, join date, bio)
       - ActivityFeed (list of recent user actions)
       
       Data Flow:
       - On mount: fetch GET /users/{id}
       - Edit button: navigate to /profile/edit
       - Activity feed: fetch GET /users/{id}/activities
       
       States:
       - Loading: show skeleton
       - Error: show error message with retry
       - Empty activities: show empty state
       
       Interactions:
       - Edit button opens edit mode
       - Avatar click shows full-size image
       ```
   - Include component tree and data requirements
   - Specify loading, error, and empty states explicitly

5. **Integration Phase**
   - State management setup
   - API integration
   - Navigation flow
   - Error handling and loading states
   - Authentication flow

## Instruction Aspects - Detailed Recommendations

### 1. Rules Files

**Recommended Approach: Layered Rules**

Create **multiple focused rule files** rather than one monolithic file:

**`.cursorrules` (Global)**
```markdown
# Core Development Principles

## Code Quality
- Write clean, readable, self-documenting code
- Follow SOLID principles
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Keep functions small and focused (single responsibility)

## Testing
- Write unit tests for business logic
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Aim for meaningful test coverage, not just high percentages

## Error Handling
- Use explicit error types/classes
- Never swallow exceptions
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors with appropriate context

## Documentation
- Document complex logic and business rules
- Keep comments focused on "why", not "what"
- Update documentation when changing behavior
```

**`backend/.cursorrules`**
```markdown
# Backend Development Rules

## Architecture
- Follow Controller → Service → Repository pattern
- Controllers: Handle HTTP, validation, response formatting
- Services: Implement business logic, orchestrate repositories
- Repositories: Data access only, no business logic

## API Design
- Use RESTful conventions
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes
- Validate all inputs at controller level
- Use DTOs for request/response, entities for data layer

## Dependencies
- Prefer {preferred ORM/database library}
- Use {validation library} for input validation
- Follow {logging approach}

## Testing
- Service layer must have unit tests
- Use mocks for repository dependencies
- Test business rule edge cases
```

**`frontend/.cursorrules`**
```markdown
# Frontend Development Rules

## Component Architecture
- Functional components with hooks only
- Keep components focused (single responsibility)
- Extract complex logic into custom hooks
- Separate container (smart) from presentation (dumb) components

## State Management
- Use {state management approach}
- Keep state close to where it's used
- Lift state only when necessary for sharing

## API Integration
- All API calls through centralized client
- Handle loading, error, and success states
- Use {data fetching library if applicable}

## Styling
- Use {styling approach: Tailwind/CSS Modules/Styled Components}
- Follow design system tokens
- Ensure responsive design for all components
```

**Pros:**
- Focused, relevant rules per context
- Easier to maintain and update
- Lower token count per request
- AI agent gets exactly the context needed

**Cons:**
- Need to maintain multiple files
- Might need to reference patterns between files

**Pitfalls to Avoid:**
- ❌ Overly prescriptive step-by-step processes (AI agents can plan)
- ❌ Listing every design pattern (reference key ones relevant to your domain)
- ❌ Copy-pasting framework documentation (AI already knows)
- ❌ Detailed formatting rules (use linters instead)

**Key Consideration**: Rules should focus on **decisions and preferences**, not knowledge the AI already has.

### 2. Task Scope

**Recommended Approach: Bounded Domain Tasks**

**Backend:**
- ✅ **Task per domain/resource** (e.g., "Implement User management")
- ✅ Include 3-7 related endpoints per task
- ✅ Include models, service logic, repository, controller, and tests
- ❌ Not: Single endpoint tasks (too granular, loses context)
- ❌ Not: Entire application (too large, hard to review)

**Frontend:**
- ✅ **Task per screen or workflow** (e.g., "Implement user authentication flow")
- ✅ Include 2-4 related screens/components
- ✅ Include routing, state management for that flow
- ❌ Not: Single component tasks (unless it's a complex shared component)
- ❌ Not: Entire application

**Atomic Components Exception**: These can be individual tasks when building the component library, as they're self-contained.

**Pros:**
- Maintains context and coherence within a domain
- Produces testable, verifiable deliverables
- Allows for meaningful code review
- Reduces back-and-forth iterations

**Cons:**
- Requires more upfront planning to define domains
- May need to refactor boundaries after learning

**Pitfalls:**
- Tasks too large → AI loses focus, mixes concerns
- Tasks too small → loses business context, creates inconsistencies
- Unclear task boundaries → AI makes wrong assumptions

**Key Consideration**: Each task should answer: "What is the complete, testable feature being delivered?"

### 3. Level of Detail in Requirements

**Recommended Approach: Specification + Constraints**

**Backend: High Detail**
```markdown
## Create Order Endpoint

**Endpoint**: POST /orders
**Auth**: Required (customer role)

**Input Model**: CreateOrderRequest
{
  "items": [{"productId": "uuid", "quantity": number}],
  "shippingAddress": "string",
  "paymentMethodId": "uuid"
}

**Validation Rules**:
- items array: 1-50 items
- quantity: 1-100 per item
- shippingAddress: required, max 500 chars
- paymentMethodId: must exist and belong to authenticated user

**Business Logic**:
1. Verify all products exist and are in stock
2. Calculate total price (products + tax + shipping)
3. Validate payment method can cover total
4. Reserve inventory (update product stock)
5. Create order with 'pending' status
6. Process payment (call payment service)
7. If payment succeeds: update order status to 'confirmed', send confirmation email
8. If payment fails: release inventory, update order status to 'failed'

**Output**: OrderDTO (includes orderId, status, total, estimated delivery)

**Error Cases**:
- 400: Validation failed (return field-specific errors)
- 404: Product not found
- 409: Insufficient stock
- 402: Payment failed
- 500: System error

**Database Changes**:
- Create order record
- Create order_items records
- Update product inventory
- Create payment_transaction record
```

**Frontend: Structured Detail**
```markdown
## Checkout Screen

**Figma**: [link]

**Purpose**: User reviews order and completes purchase

**Layout Structure**:
- Header: "Checkout" with back button
- Order Summary Card
  - List of items with thumbnails, names, quantities, prices
  - Subtotal, tax, shipping, total
- Shipping Address Section
  - Display saved address or form to enter new
  - "Change" button if address saved
- Payment Method Section
  - Display saved payment method or form to add
  - Shows last 4 digits of card
- Place Order Button (primary CTA)

**Data Requirements**:
- Cart items: from local state or GET /cart
- Shipping address: GET /users/me/addresses (default)
- Payment methods: GET /users/me/payment-methods (default)

**User Interactions**:
- Change address: opens address selection modal
- Change payment: opens payment method selection modal
- Place Order: 
  - Disable button and show loading
  - POST /orders with cart contents
  - On success: navigate to /orders/{orderId}/confirmation
  - On error: show error message below button, keep on same screen

**States**:
- Loading: skeleton for all sections
- Empty cart: show "Your cart is empty" message with "Continue Shopping" button
- Error loading data: show error message with retry button
- Submitting order: disable form, show loading spinner on button
- Submit error: show error message, allow retry

**Responsive Behavior**:
- Mobile: single column, sticky button at bottom
- Desktop: two column (summary on right)

**Edge Cases**:
- No saved address: force address entry
- No saved payment: force payment entry
- Cart modified during checkout: reload cart data
```

**Pros:**
- AI produces code matching your expectations
- Fewer iterations and corrections needed
- Consistent implementation across features
- Clear acceptance criteria for review

**Cons:**
- More upfront work to write requirements
- May constrain AI from suggesting improvements
- Can become tedious for simple features

**Pitfalls:**
- Over-specifying implementation details (e.g., "use a for loop") → constrains AI unnecessarily
- Under-specifying business rules → AI makes assumptions
- Ambiguous language → AI interprets differently than intended

**Key Consideration**: Be specific about **what** and **why**, flexible about **how** (unless there's a good reason).

## Additional Critical Aspects You Might Have Missed

### 4. Context Management

**Problem**: AI agents lose context in long conversations or across multiple files.

**Recommendations**:
- **Reference Documents**: Create and reference `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `API_SPEC.md`, `COMPONENT_INVENTORY.md`
- **Explicit File References**: When giving tasks, explicitly mention files the AI should consider
- **Conversation Checkpoints**: After completing a domain, summarize what was done before moving on
- **Workspace Context**: Keep related files close together; AI uses file proximity for context

### 5. Verification Strategy

**Problem**: How do you verify AI-generated code efficiently?

**Recommendations**:
- **Test-First for Complex Logic**: Write test cases first for critical business logic, let AI implement to pass tests
- **Automated Checks**: 
  - Linting and formatting (automatic)
  - Type checking (TypeScript/mypy)
  - Unit test coverage thresholds
  - Integration test suite
- **Manual Review Focus**:
  - Business logic correctness
  - Security implications (auth, validation, data exposure)
  - Error handling completeness
  - Edge cases coverage
- **Incremental Integration**: Merge and test each domain before moving to next

### 6. Error Recovery Patterns

**Problem**: What to do when AI produces incorrect or incomplete code?

**Recommendations**:
- **Be Specific About the Issue**: "The password validation doesn't check for special characters as specified in requirement 3b"
- **Provide Examples**: "The error response should be: `{error: 'validation_failed', details: [{field: 'email', message: 'Invalid format'}]}`"
- **Reference Rules**: "This violates the repository pattern defined in backend/.cursorrules"
- **Rollback Strategy**: Use git branches per task so you can easily revert
- **Escalation Path**: Some things AI struggles with (complex algorithms, performance optimization) → do manually

### 7. Documentation Generation

**Problem**: Keeping documentation in sync with code.

**Recommendations**:
- **Task Requirement**: Each task should update relevant documentation
- **Auto-Generated Docs**: 
  - OpenAPI/Swagger for backend APIs (generate from code)
  - Storybook for frontend components (write stories as part of component tasks)
- **Change Logs**: Ask AI to document significant changes or decisions made during implementation

### 8. Dependency Management

**Problem**: AI might introduce unnecessary dependencies or use outdated patterns.

**Recommendations**:
- **Approved Dependencies**: List allowed libraries in rules
- **Justification Required**: "Before adding a new dependency, explain why existing solutions are insufficient"
- **Version Locking**: Specify versions in rules if using specific features
- **Regular Updates**: Periodically review and update approved dependency list

### 9. Code Consistency

**Problem**: AI might implement similar features differently across the codebase.

**Recommendations**:
- **Reference Implementations**: "Follow the pattern established in UserController for authentication"
- **Consistency Checks**: "Ensure error handling matches the pattern in OrderService"
- **Style Guide**: Beyond basic formatting, establish patterns for common scenarios (pagination, filtering, sorting)

### 10. Performance Considerations

**Problem**: AI often prioritizes working code over performant code.

**Recommendations**:
- **Explicit Performance Requirements**: "This endpoint will handle 1000 requests/minute"
- **Include in Rules**: "Consider query performance; use appropriate indexes"
- **Review Checklist**: After implementation, check for N+1 queries, unnecessary loops, missing pagination
