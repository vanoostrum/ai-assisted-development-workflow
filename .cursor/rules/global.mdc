# Core Development Principles

## Code Quality
- Write clean, readable, self-documenting code
- Follow SOLID principles
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Keep functions small and focused (single responsibility)
- Keep code DRY

## Testing
- Write unit tests for business logic
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Aim for meaningful test coverage, not just high percentages

## Error Handling
- Use explicit error types/classes
- Never swallow exceptions
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors with appropriate context
- Prefer to let unexpected errors be handled by the exception handling middleware. Only catch and handle errors if some meaningfull action can be taken

## Documentation
- Document complex logic and business rules
- Keep comments focused on "why", not "what"
- Update documentation when changing behavior
